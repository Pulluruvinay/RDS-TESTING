# AWS RDS - User Information App

This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates how to build a simple web app using **Python Flask** and **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)**.

The application collects user information from a form and stores it in an RDS database. It also retrieves stored user data and displays it through the web application.

## Project Overview

AWS RDS is a managed relational database service that simplifies setting up, operating, and scaling databases in the cloud. Using RDS, you don’t need to worry about database administration tasks like patching, backups, and replication.

This project shows how to:
- Connect a Flask web application to an AWS RDS database
- Perform basic **CRUD** operations
- Use RDS for durable, scalable, and secure database storage

## Key Concepts Covered

- **AWS RDS Instance Setup**
- **Database connectivity from application**
- **Storing and fetching data using SQL**
- **Python Flask application architecture**
- **Security and configuration using environment variables**

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask
- AWS RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL etc.)
- HTML/Jinja templates

## Usage

1. Clone the repository  
2. Configure database credentials  
3. Install dependencies  
4. Run the Flask app
